                <strong>“That’s where the money’s at!”</strong> -everyone when I tell them I’m a CS major. If you asked me if I liked being a computer science major, I’d tell you I loved it but if you were to ask me on a deeper level, I’d tell you how much I hate it. 

                <br>Being a computer science major, there’s a stigma that you’re smart or someone who can learn very quickly but I believe I’m short of that. I’ve never had the best grades since the pandemic hit, my discipline and motivation for my academics continue to decrease as I gradually follow my degree, and I don’t have any good study habits. I chose to be a CS major because I thought it was interesting to see what could be created by the knowledge of coding. Video games, bluetooth, sorting algorithms, software, and how big companies can get are just some that I found interesting. By this time, CS was popularized by mainstream content creators on social media, highlighting that it’s a low maintenance job with high return. Little did I know, the term “low maintenance “can be entirely different for everyone and that was the case for me!
                    
                <br><strong>I’d be lying if I said Cal Poly was amongst my top choices.</strong> Cal Poly Slo was one of the only schools that accepted me and I was eager being told that it was a great university! But what I’ve grown to like about this school is the student to faculty ratio and how green this campus is. There’s nothing too unique about my experience except that I was once a NASA hackathon volunteer! <em>Hopefully in the next 5-10 years, I’d be graduated with my bachelors (maybe master’s), working for a good company as a remote SWE, travelled majority of the world, and maybe married.</em> I hope Cal Poly can reveal to me the importance of Computer Science by utilizing their “hands on learning” but I hope the school can help me create a video game that can be easily accessible and flexible for accessible individuals. Being a failure scares me. There’s been a plethora of videos on social media showing the layoffs in the tech industry and decline in the job market. My biggest worry is what if I can’t find a job? What if AI runs over my job field? <em>What if…</em> so many what ifs. In the end, I am excited to see what Cal Poly has to offer in regards to showing me how to encounter the real world.
